For these past few years, I haven't been posting, but I wanted to get back into slowing sharing my life.

All of these events could have been posts, but life is so unpredictable and sometimes a bit overwhelming. As my interests are in technology, finance, and travelling, I would likely cover in these topics in this blog.
