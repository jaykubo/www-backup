For this post, I wanted to share my investment decisions that worked out and affected how I live my life today.

## $TSLA

In March of 2020, I had a net worth of about $150K. During the market crash, I moved about a third of my portfolio into $TSLA call options (strike of $200 post-split) with the intention of selling them in a year. However, I also had an urge to diversify into further out strike dates/prices (in technical terms - rolling diagonal spreads), so I ended up paying the short term tax bracket. In 2020, I ended with over 800K in income and paid just under 300K in taxes.

Despite this, today, I still have about $1M in $TSLA from this decision I made at that moment. In hindsight, I wish I borrowed some money so I would have had more financial freedom today, but with my past experience getting margin called, I did not want to mix margin with options again.

## $DOGE

While $1M isn't a lot, it was still enough for me to diversity along the way to make more decisions. From around June of 2020, I started buying $DOGE and accumulated about 10M $DOGE at around a cost of $50K. I used margin and was forced to sell while getting my mortgage loan approved for purchasing my house, but I bought back (more) once it was approved (thankfully, the mooning hadn't started yet).

At it's peak this year in 2021, this position reached about $7-8M, but today it is sitting at about $2-3M. I sold some along the way to cover my initial investment, but I still do hold most of them as I believe in the future of cryptocurrencies.

While it is easy to become complacent, I wanted to remind myself that it is important to manage finances responsibly and stay humble. I do not want to forget the pain of not having enough - the frustration/struggle and fear/stress.
